description: At So Cheesy, we are passionate about serving our customers with the highest quality ingredients and hospitality. Our journey began in July of 2023 out of a food truck. Four months later, with the support of our loyal customers, we were able to build an indoor dining hall. The So Cheesy vision is to showcase scratch kitchen, gourmet dishes out of a food truck. Today, we continue to uphold his vision by offering a diverse menu filled with flavorful dishes that are sure to satisfy any palate.
