description: Established in 2019, with one goal in mind...to make each and every experience with us a memorable one. Our wide array of menu items has something for everyone! Our secret is simple, everything is made from the heart. Why Fratelli's? Because we are so much more than pizza!  Not only are we famous for pizzas, but we are also famous for our Smash Burgers, Crispy Chicken Sandwiches, Fish & Chips, Wings & Tenders, Fish & Shrimp Tacos and so much more!
