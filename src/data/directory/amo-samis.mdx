description: Amo Sami’s Shawarma brings the rich, authentic flavors of old Beirut to the heart of Metro Detroit, one sandwich at a time. Inspired by the bustling streets of Hamra and the vibrant alleyways of Gemmayze, our sandwiches capture the essence of Lebanese street food. Each sandwich is crafted with the same passion and tradition you’d find in the markets of Beirut, offering a taste of home for those who long for it and a new culinary adventure for those yet to discover it. Come experience the flavors of Beirut, wrapped in our famous Sami-style pita, right here at Amo Sami’s.
